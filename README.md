Regression Analysis (Main)
This group is determined to make learning 'Regression Analysis' a more beginner-friendly and visually straightforward process. The goal is mainly to help students thoroughly understand the following: 

1. Various probability distributions and their relationships.
2. Building up (generalised) linear models and making predictions
3. (Hopefully) Non-parametric regression with smoothing Splines, for example
4. (Hopefully) Bayesian Inference and regression.

During this academic year (18/19), it is essential to establish a solid foundation with applications that can cover as many statistical concepts as possible. However, any proposal of individual projects will be very much welcome and could be discussed in the forum/during the weekly meeting. Once a team of interested people has been gathered, a subgroup can be set up in the main grouping of RA.
